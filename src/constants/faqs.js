    question: `While replacing the battery or cleaning the terminals,
        why is it important to remove the ground wire first?`,
    answer: `Before you start, always check the type of grounding
        system the vehicle has. If you remove the positive
        connector first in a negative ground system, a spark may
        be created in the process. It could happen if the metal
        tool you're using to remove the positive terminal
        connector comes in contact with any piece of metal in the
        car. If you are working near the battery when this occurs,
        it might create fire source causing the battery to
        explode. It's extremely important to remove the ground
        source first.`,

    question: `How do I safely jump-start my battery?`,
    answer: `WARNING:Modern vehicles with electronic management
    systems should not be jump started without "protected"
    jump starter leads and it is necessary to refer to the
    owner's handbook for jump starting procedures for such
    vehicles. Vehicle Jump Starting procedure is as follows
    and should be followed carefully: Ensure battery for
    jump-starting and vehicle battery are of the same declared
    voltage (say 12V) Turn off all electrical loads, check
    vehicles so that they are not touching each other and are
    in neutral. Check that vehicles have the same terminal
    earthed, If not, refer to manufacturers' instructions.
    Check that cables are not frayed or damaged. Carry out the
    following steps in sequence:
 
    On negative grounded system, connect positive of
    jump-starting battery to the positive of the stalled car
    battery . Connect one end of other cable to negative (-)
    terminal of booster battery. Connect other cable away from
    battery, to engine block or car frame of the vehicle to be
    started. Make sure cables are away from fan blades and
    other moving vehicle parts. If vehicle does not start
    within 30 seconds, call an auto electrician. After
    starting, remove cables in reverse order, starting with
    one connected to engine block or car frame.`,
